# üìò Unit 01: Full-Stack Architecture ‚Äì Assignment 1  

## üìå Overview  
This repository contains my solution for **Unit 01: Homework Assignment ‚Äì Prototype Blitz** as part of the **Amana Bootcamp Full-Stack Program**.  

The goal of this assignment was to **translate product ideas into low-fidelity prototypes and architecture diagrams**, focusing on:  
- Identifying **system components** (client, server, database, external services).  
- Mapping **user interactions** with the system.  
- Practicing **rapid prototyping** before jumping into coding.

## üìù Assignment Tasks  
We were asked to create **four prototypes and architecture diagrams** for the following product concepts:  

### 1. Fundraising Platform (ImanGiving)  
- A community-driven donation platform.  
- Features: campaign pages, secure payments (Stripe/Square), admin dashboard, donor receipts.  

### 2. AI-Powered Support Agent  
- A customer support widget.  
- Features: floating chat icon, AI-generated responses, escalation to human agents.  

### 3. Cybersecurity Incident Analyzer  
- A tool for analyzing and categorizing security incidents.  
- Features: threat detection, reporting, response recommendations.  

### 4. Task Tracker (Choose Your Own Project)  
- A simple productivity app that helps users manage their daily tasks.  
- Features:  
  - **Login Page** for user authentication.  
  - **Home Page** showing all tasks with filters for pending/completed.  
  - **Add Task Page** with task details, priority, due date, and optional **email reminders**.  
  - **Completed Tasks Page** displaying finished tasks with stats, strike-through titles, and restore/delete options.  
- Integrations: external **email reminder service** for pending tasks.

Each prototype included:  
- **Low-fidelity wireframes** (e.g., in Figma/Excalidraw/Miro).  
- **Architecture diagrams** showing interaction points with the server, external APIs, and databases.

## üéØ What We Learned This Week  

During **Unit 01: Full-Stack Architecture**, the key takeaways were:  

- **Architecture before coding**:  
  Junior developers often rush into coding, but without proper planning, projects become overcomplicated, confusing, or misaligned with requirements.  

- **The value of prototyping**:  
  Building low-fidelity prototypes helps visualize the product and validate features early, saving time and effort later.  

- **Client‚Äìserver thinking**:  
  Every prototype was mapped to how it interacts with the backend, database, and external services.  

- **Efficiency in teamwork**:  
  Group work and structured planning allow clearer collaboration and faster progress.  

- **End-to-end application mindset**:  
  The bootcamp emphasizes building applications that are **comprehensive and production-ready**, not just coded features in isolation.

## üí° Reflection  

This assignment was a strong introduction to thinking like a **full-stack engineer**. I learned to:  
- Break down big ideas into **clear architectures**.  
- Use **wireframes and diagrams** to communicate system design.  
- Appreciate the importance of **planning before coding**.  

Going forward, I aim to:  
- Improve the **level of detail** in my prototypes.  
- Explore more **real-world product references** for inspiration.  
- Continue honing my **architecture design skills** for future projects.
